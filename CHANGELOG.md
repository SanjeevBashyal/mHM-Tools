# Changelog

## [v0.2.2]

### Fixed

- Fix `create-mhm-restart-from-setup` merge producing an mHM-unreadable restart file: soil-horizon, land-cover-period, and LAI-timestep boundaries were looked up under invented native variable names, and a missing `return` corrupted the default six-horizon boundaries — both silently replaced real depths/periods/months with meaningless index values that mHM rejected on restart.
- Fix border-clobbering when merging restart tiles shared across multiple mask/parameter runs: a later tile's fill/NaN cells could overwrite an earlier tile's valid data at the same position.
- Mask each tile restart file in place with its own tile mask before it is moved or merged, so unmasked edge values can no longer leak into relocated or merged restart output.
- Write a tile's mask section on demand when reusing an existing tile setup (`--no-tile-creation`) whose `mask_tile.nc` predates this file, instead of requiring the whole tile to be recreated.

### Added

- Always derive `L1_soilMoist` in the merged restart as the midpoint between `L1_wiltingPoint` and `L1_soilMoistFC` when both are available, overwriting any value a native tile restart may already carry.

### Removed

- Remove the unused `merge_mhm_restart_files` restart-merge pipeline and the ~15 helper functions reachable only from it (superseded in production by `merge_restart_files`), plus dead entries in the internal variable/dimension rename lookup tables that never matched real mHM restart output.

## [v0.2.1]

### Fixed

- Calculate hydrograph KGE/NSE from the cropped overlapping discharge period instead of stale pre-crop arrays.
- Keep hydrograph objective and catchment state per `Hydrograph` instance to avoid stale metrics leaking between runs.
- Limit mHM restart tile-mask discovery to the restart output folder and owning tile folder to avoid unrelated parent masks affecting merges.
- Apply gridded ESP and SPAEF-like metrics per timestep before averaging, instead of flattening the full time-space array first.
- Handle single-point temporal overlaps in xarray utilities and improve the related crop error logging.
- Fix `create_header()` output handling for explicit file paths, missing parent directories, and existing directories with dots in the name.
- Prevent file output helpers from replacing existing files when the requested output path has no file suffix.
- Handle dotted gauge output directories in catchment creation.
- Use lon/lat box resolution as fallback for L0 resolution in `create-catchment`.
- Added ("longitude", "latitude") to possible xy coordinates in discharge file

### Changed

- Write catchment gauge-correction `score`, `shape_error`, and `method` columns to the gauge info CSV.
- Refactor NetCDF writing into `write_xarray_to_netcdf()` and shared helpers in `mhm_tools.common.netcdf`.
- Update install instructions in the README.

### Tests

- Add catchment gauge info CSV coverage for correction score, shape error, and method metadata.
- Add regression coverage for hydrograph KGE after cropping.
- Add `create_header()` path handling coverage, including CLI `--only-header` output to an explicit file.
- Add and update NetCDF encoding tests for the refactored NetCDF helper functions.
- Update spatial metric tests for corrected ESP/SPAEF output names and timestep-wise behavior.
- Add xarray overlap regression coverage.

## [v0.2]

### Added

- Initial official release for mHM 5 pre-processing, post-processing, and evaluation workflows.
- Add `create-catchment` to delineate basins from DEM or flow-direction data, correct gauge outlets by area or shape, and write mHM/mRM basin, mask, idgauges, and gauge metadata outputs.
- Add `crop-mhm-setup` to crop existing mHM setups to domains, masks, or bounding boxes while preserving required grid files and headers.
- Add `create-header` and `latlon` tools to generate mHM-compatible ASCII headers and lon/lat NetCDF grids from setup extents and resolutions.
- Add `prepare-mhm-forcings` and `calculate-pet` to prepare meteorological forcings, normalize units, handle temporal frequency, and derive PET fields.
- Add `create-mhm-restart-file` and `create-mhm-restart-from-setup` to build restart files from target grids or tiled setup runs, including masking and merge support.
- Add `create-subdomain-masks`, `create-idgauges`, and region/catchment masking helpers for domain partitioning and routing setup preparation.
- Add data-processing tools for file conversion, merging many files, regridding, filling missing values, calculating long-term means, ratios, differences, and relative differences.
- Add `discharge-evaluation` to compare observed and simulated discharge, match gauges, calculate metrics, and create CDF and map outputs.
- Add `hydrograph` to read discharge series, calculate objective metrics, and create hydrograph, seasonality, scatter, and flow-duration plots.
- Add `gridded-data-evaluation` for spatial and temporal comparison of gridded model outputs with metrics such as ESP, SPAEF, MSPAEF, and WASPAEF.
- Add `mhm-run-overview`, `2d-map`, and `taylor-diagram` tools for run summaries and visualization.
- Add utility commands such as `link-folder-tree` and initial mHM 5 to mHM 6 land-cover ASCII-to-NetCDF conversion support.

### Changed

- Switch to the Click-based CLI with grouped commands, aliases, typo suggestions, and optional Trogon support.
- Improve NetCDF metadata, coordinate handling, mask handling, and output provenance across generated files.

### Fixed

- Stabilize catchment shape and area correction, gridded evaluation masking, restart creation from setup tiles, hydrograph reading, and header generation.
